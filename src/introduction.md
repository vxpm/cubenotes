This book is a collection of notes about the Nintendo GameCube, geared towards emulator development.

> [!NOTE]
> While information in this book is supposed to be correct, it might just not be! Documentation on
> the gamecube is scarce and it's not uncommon for it to be wrong.
>
> These notes are mostly just me trying to share what I've learned and found while developing my own
> GameCube emulator. If my understanding is wrong, sorry!
>
> If you find something wrong or missing, please [open an issue](https://github.com/vxpm/cubenotes/issues/new)
> or create a pull request. Help cubenotes become better!

# Texture Coordinate Generator (TC)

The texture coordinate generator (TC) is responsible for generating texture coordinates to be used
by the TEV during texture sampling. The process of generating texture coordinates is called texgen.

There are 8 texture coordinate channels, each configured separatedly.
